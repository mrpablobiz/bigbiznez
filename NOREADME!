At one point in time the mans was stagnant
There was too many of things in one place
and not enough elsewhere
and too much blank paper stacked by a door that did not exist
Then one day a mans said enough
and created biz
and biz was good

He took the paper and forged dollar
dollar was used to buy fruit
fruit was eaten then man was full
then man needed more dollar for more fruit
So he went to work at the biz

He hammered documents into existence
he whispered spreadsheets into the world
slideshows soon fell from the heavens
and an hr department grew from the earth

and man said this is the biz
and the biz is good
and the biz was good

Soon everyone was in the biz
mothers father daughers mailmen and even Greg
Everyone had dollars
everyone had fruit
and then we realized that we were all back where we started
The world was stangant
The biz had consumed all
The biz was good
but the biz was all

Then one Monday a new voice appeared
A new one came up and spoke against the biz
They saud the biz is good yes
but the biz can be better
I can make the biz better
A new biz where we not only use dollars for fruit
but for more

He took the fruit from the tree and refused to budge
no matter how many dollar he was offered
He stood
He waited
and he learned

Soon mans knew hunger
Mans had dollar but could not have fruit
The new man finaly came to the mans and said
Join me and you will know biz
you will know fruit
and you will know dollar

The mans joined the biz
now two biz were
now the dollar became more than it could ever dream

The new man stood upon the dollars and proclaimed
here be biz for all and fruit and dollar
will be new and interesting

The mans ask how this was possible
how biz had gotten so much better
how biz that was once one became two became infinite
how the stagnation thw was in the biz came to consume them
and how he alone created the light that guided them into the new and eternal biz

He looked and smilled
he reached down and spoke

I watched Pabz business stream and leaned how to do a business
I learned of fruit 
I learned of dollar
I learned of biz
And now i use them to make you 
the world
the biz
Eternal

Then he left us
He hath accended to a higher plane of business
where he watches over us and guides us
and smiles upon us 
his warmth guides us in our fruit and dollar and biz
